# GreenAdvisor: AI Agent for Smart Farming Advice

GreenAdvisor is an AI-powered smart farming assistant designed to support small-scale farmers in India by providing personalized, real-time, and localized agricultural advice. It leverages IBM Cloud Lite and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to deliver multilingual, context-aware recommendations on weather, soil health, crop selection, pest management, and market prices.

## Problem Statement

Small-scale farmers in India often lack access to timely, localized, and actionable agricultural information, leading to reduced yields and income instability. The project addresses this gap by providing an AI-based conversational agent that interacts in local languages and retrieves trusted data for smart farming decisions.

## Features

- Conversational interface with multilingual text and voice support
- Real-time weather, soil, crop, pest, and market price information
- Personalized crop and fertilizer recommendations based on soil and season
- Pest and disease control advice
- Continuous learning from user queries and feedback

## Technology Stack

- IBM Cloud Lite (Watson Studio, Watson Assistant, Object Storage)
- IBM Granite LLM for multi-language support
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for AI-driven knowledge retrieval and response generation
- Containerized backend with REST APIs for mobile, web, and voice interface integration

## How It Works

1. Farmer submits a query in their local language via text or voice
2. System preprocesses and translates queries if needed
3. RAG retrieves relevant data from trusted agricultural sources
4. AI generates precise and actionable advice tailored to user context
5. Recommendations are provided dynamically and updated continuously

## Future Enhancements

- Support for additional Indian regional languages
- Integration of satellite imagery for crop and soil diagnostics
- Personalized alerts for weather, pest outbreaks, and market trends
- Offline edge deployment and IoT integration for automatic data capture
